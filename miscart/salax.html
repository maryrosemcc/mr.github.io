           Salax 
             </p>
           2024 |  13  x 7  x 13 in |  <i>projector, super 8 film, salt, ink, fabric, geranium and winterleaf oil, glue, shell, polymer clay </i><br>   
           <br>

           In Ancient Rome, a man in love was called a <i> Salax</i>. He was too in love to realize that he was over-salting the food. <br> <br>  <i> Salax </i> started as a superstition. A broken Super 8 projector shapeshifted into a creature soaked in salt and ink. A sel-portrait.
           <br>  <br> 

As you approach <i> Salax</i>, you are invited to and guided through a multi-sensory experience of touch, scent, taste, sight, and sound. This sculptural piece experiments with the material transformation of Super-8mm film, the symbolic significance of salt (salt as initiation, preservation, hospitality, wisdom, magic, captial, covenant, etc.), along with the purpose of waste.
 <br>  <br> 
What can become of the broken? <br>
