This website is a work-in-progess. I am still in the process of cataloguing my creative projects (and creating projects for audiences other than myself).<br>
          <br>
          
I currently work as a Studio Assistant for an experimental filmmaker. <br> <br>
          
BA from New York University, Gallatin School of Individualized Study in 2020 with a minor in French studies. My academic concentration focused specifically on the ways visual culture shapes Empire and vice versa, through a historical grounding in the second wave of French colonialism. 
            <br>
            <br>

Analog and digital experimental filmmaking encompass my main domain of artistic interest, along with some other <a href="misc.html">miscellaneous</a> creations. I do use ink to write, but don't be mislead by my domain name (it was only 2 bucks!).
<br>
            <br>
3 words to describe my arts practice? <br> esoteric, playful, stylized :)
<br>
<br>         
           
My full CV and design portfolio are available upon request.
